A few sentences about my professional and personal life.

#### Professional life
I've worked in many different functions over the past few years that might seem like they have very little to do with one another, but there are some common elements. 
- Identifying problems inside complex organizations and systems
- Coming up with different ways of solving a problem
- Trying out different solutions until I either succeed or run out of ideas
- Reflecting on why something did or did not work, and trying to do better next time

If you really want to see exactly what I've been up to, check out my [resume](https://github.com/dhrunlauwers/dhrunlauwers.github.io/raw/master/downloads/dhrun_resume.pdf).

#### Personal life
I was born in Belgium, and I have been living in Toronto for more than 20 years. I like to spend my free time with family and friends, as well as side projects like this very website.

I've also been fortunate enough to have done quite a bit of traveling, which is something I really enjoy.

I hope to share a post with some travel pictures soon, which I will link to here.
