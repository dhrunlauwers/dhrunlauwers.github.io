Hello world!

I decided it would be in my interest to build a simple blog. There are a couple of reasons for this: 
1. Putting ideas into writing helps me think about problems and situations more clearly (and keeps me from forgetting important things)
2. It seems like a fun way to build a portfolio of thoughts and experiments to share with others
3. I recently started school and have a bit of extra time to spend on side projects

If you happen to stumble on this page in it's current state, my sincere apologies. 

Rest assured, there is nothing interesting here (yet).
