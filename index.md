Hello world!

I decided it would be in my interest to build a simple blog. There are a couple of reasons for this: 
1. Putting ideas into writing helps me think about problems and situations more clearly (and keeps me from forgetting important things)
2. It seems like a fun way to build a portfolio of thoughts and experiments to share with others
3. I recently started school and have a bit of extra time to spend on side projects

Each page and post in the blog includes some content and a picture I took somewhere abroad. I hope the pictures will give you a reason to check out each page, even if the content is not that great :)
