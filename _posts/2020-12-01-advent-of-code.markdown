The Advent of Code is upon us! A short post to call attention to this wonderful series of daily code problems in the form of an advent calendar. It's a great way to learn how to code in any language.

I'll be keeping my solutions on [github](https://github.com/dhrunlauwers/advent_2020) in case anyone gets stuck! If my solution doesn't make sense, make sure to look for explainers on YouTube or elsewhere. One of my favourite people to check for solutions is [Joel Grus's channel](https://www.youtube.com/joelgrus).
